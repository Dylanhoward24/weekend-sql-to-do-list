# Weekend SQL TO-DO LIST

[ ] Build out a to-do list for users to track their tasks
    [ ] Setup
        [X] Create organizational folders/files (modules, routes, public, server, etc.)
        [X] Create required files in the above folders (index.html, client.js, server.js, etc)
        [X] Put basic required code in each of the files
        [X] Connect files together (link, source, require, etc)
        [X] npm install express, body-parser, and pg
        [X] Make the data base using postico (db name = weekend_to_do_app)
    [ ] Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a task
        [X] Create input fields, submit button, and table on index.html
        [ ] Created tasks should be stored in the database (SQL)
        [ ] Client-side should refresh every time you add a new task
        [ ] Each task needs to have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'
        [ ] Whether or not a task is complete should also be stored in the database
        [ ] Deleting a task should remove it both from the front end as well as database
    [ ] Styling
        [ ] When a task is completed, change the background color of the task container
            from one color to another (example gray to green)
        [ ] The complete option should be 'checked off'
